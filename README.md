Chosen Theme: Economic Development and Financial Markets

1. How do comments by people on social media and online forums impact stock market fluctuations in developing countries?

We will examine here how online opinions from social media or financial forums affect stock market changes within developing countries. We want to see how discussions relating to companies, products, or industries affect the financial decisions of investors.
After looking at these online talks, we want to see how much power these shared opinions have on stock prices. Of course, regular people don't move the market like Elon Musk, whose tweets can make Dogecoin's value go to the moon! :) 
Lastly, we will learn how online sentiments, from influential or ordinary users, impact financial markets. To simplify the study, we will focus on specific platforms such as Twitter and niche financial forums.

2. How do factors like average income, inflation rates, and savings behavior of a developing country affect a family's ability to buy a mid-priced Yamaha violin, and what does that say about the financial accessibility of the product in emerging markets?

We hereby would like to find out the influence of average income rates in developing countries, inflation rates, and saving habits of people on a family's ability to buy a mid-priced Yamaha violin. This section now looks at income, inflation, and saving patterns, finally pointing out how long the average household would take to save for the violin.
We believe that, with money troubles, upon examination of the data, such shall bring forth the true challenges that families face in the developing countries. In countries such as Brazil, India, or Turkey—each grappling with a different problem related to money and differing opportunities for economic growth—it shall be observed.

3. What is the long-term impact of educational investments on individual income in developing countries?
In this study we will analyze the role of education in economic development by examining the relationship between the average years of schooling and individual income. Our aim is to understand the long-term impact of educational investments on individual income in developing countries. It will explore how increasing years of schooling contributes to individual income levels.
Hypothesis Testing: Testing if longer years of schooling leads to a significant increase in individual income.
Regression Analysis: To find the correlation between years of schooling and individual income.
