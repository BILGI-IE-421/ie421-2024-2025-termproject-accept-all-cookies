# Economic Development and Financial Markets - Data Science Term Project

This project investigates the theme of **Economic Development and Financial Markets**, focusing on data analysis and insights related to stock market fluctuations, the financial accessibility of products in emerging markets, and blockchain-based financial services in developing countries.

## Research Questions:

1. **How do comments by people on social media and online forums impact stock market fluctuations in developing countries?**
   - This research will examine how online opinions, especially from platforms like Twitter and financial forums, affect stock market changes in developing countries. It looks at whether discussions about companies, industries, or products influence financial decisions of investors and how much these shared sentiments impact stock prices.

2. **How do factors like average income, inflation rates, and savings behavior of a developing country affect a family's ability to buy a mid-priced Yamaha violin, and what does that say about the financial accessibility of the product in emerging markets?**
   - This question explores the economic factors—such as average income, inflation, and saving habits—that determine a family's ability to purchase a mid-priced Yamaha violin. It will also highlight the financial challenges faced by households in developing countries, such as Brazil, India, and Turkey, and how long they would take to save for the violin.

3. **How can blockchain financial services help people and small businesses in developing countries get loans?**
   - This section will investigate how blockchain technology, through online platforms, helps people and small businesses in developing countries access loans without relying on traditional banks.
